# CS170_IC05_BloodAlcoholContent
The following formula gives a rough estimate of your blood alcohol content (BAC) and is derived from formulas posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:

BAC = (4.136 * numberOfDrinks * ouncesAlcohol) / weight

numberOfDrinks is the number of alcoholic drinks ingested
ouncesAlcohol is the number of ounces of alcohol per drink
weight is the weight of the drinker in pounds

Write a program that calculates the blood alcohol content of someone drinking Jagerbombs.  Assume that there are 1.5 ounces of alcohol in one Jagerbomb.  Ask the user to input values for number of drinks and weight.  Output the blood alcohol content value and whether or not the person would be legally intoxicated.  In the state of California, a person is legally intoxicated if their BAC is >= 0.08.
